# React Material-UI Data Grid — Tutorial Project

This repository is a small tutorial/demo React app that demonstrates how to build a simple data-grid style UI using Material-UI components (and the general React + Create React App toolchain).

It includes a lightweight sample dataset and three focused components to illustrate how to structure a small React UI: `Data.jsx`, `DatagridToolbar.jsx`, and `DataItem.jsx`.

This README explains what's included, how to run and extend the project, and recommended next steps and best practices.

## Contents

- Project: a Create React App based React application.
- Purpose: Demo how to present data using a grid/list with a toolbar and per-item components.
- Key files (under `src/`):
	- `App.js` — app root and router/bootstrapping UI.
	- `Data.jsx` — the main data-list/grid view that loads and renders items.
	- `DatagridToolbar.jsx` — a toolbar with search/filter controls and actions.
	- `DataItem.jsx` — per-item presentation and actions.
	- `index.js` — React entry point.
	- `App.css`, `index.css` — styles used by the app.

## What this project demonstrates

- A minimal Create React App project structure.
- Component decomposition (separate toolbar, list, and item components).
- Basic use of Material-UI components and styling patterns (assumed in the tutorial).
- How to run, test, and build a React application.


## Quick start — run locally

Prerequisites: Node.js (14+ recommended) and npm installed.

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server

```bash
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser. The app reloads on code changes.

3. Run tests (if present)

```bash
npm test
```

4. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

This produces an optimized `build/` folder ready for deployment.

## Project structure (brief)

- `public/` — static files and the HTML entry.
- `src/` — application source code.
	- `App.js` — root component that composes the UI.
	- `Data.jsx` — data listing/grid; fetches or imports sample data and maps it to `DataItem` components.
	- `DatagridToolbar.jsx` — toolbar containing search/sort controls and action buttons.
	- `DataItem.jsx` — a presentational component for a single record.
	- `Test.js`, `App.test.js`, `setupTests.js` — example tests and test setup.

When you open `src/` you'll find the small set of components used to build the demo. The intent is educational: keep component scope small and readable.

## Component contracts (tiny "contracts")

- Data.jsx
	- Inputs: an array of item objects (id, title, description, etc.) or an API endpoint.
	- Outputs: renders a list/grid of `DataItem` components.
	- Error modes: empty list, data load error handled by showing a message.

- DatagridToolbar.jsx
	- Inputs: callbacks for search/filter/sort actions.
	- Outputs: emits user events (search change, add item, refresh).

- DataItem.jsx
	- Inputs: single item object and action callbacks.
	- Outputs: UI for item plus action event handlers.

Edge cases to consider (and which the tutorial exposes):

- Empty datasets — show friendly empty state.
- Slow network — add loading states or skeletons.
- Large lists — consider virtualization or server-side pagination.

## Troubleshooting

- Dev server won't start: check Node version and reinstall node_modules (`rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install`).
- Build fails: inspect the error stack; ensure any new imports are installed.
- Styles not applying: verify `index.css`/`App.css` are imported by `index.js` or `App.js`.

## Tests and CI

This project includes the default Create React App test setup. Recommended tests:

- Unit tests for `Data.jsx` rendering with an empty list and with sample items.
- Snapshot tests for `DataItem.jsx`.
- E2E tests (optional) using Playwright or Cypress to verify user flows.

CI tips:

- Use Node matrix in GitHub Actions (e.g., Node 16/18) and run `npm ci && npm test`.

## Deployment

Build with `npm run build` and deploy the contents of the `build` folder to your static host (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, S3 + CloudFront, etc.).

If deploying to GitHub Pages from this repo, consider adding the `homepage` field to `package.json` and using `gh-pages`.

## Notes about this repository

- This repo is intended as a tutorial/demo and keeps business logic simple and readable.
- If you plan to turn it into a production project, consider adding:
	- TypeScript migration
	- Linting (ESLint) and formatters (Prettier)
	- Unit and integration tests
	- A clear CI pipeline and semantic-release or conventional commits for releases

## Contribution and license

Feel free to open issues or PRs. Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution rules if the project grows.

This repository does not include a license file. If you intend to publish it, add a `LICENSE` (MIT is a common choice for tutorial code).

## Where to look in the code (quick pointers)

- Start at `src/App.js` to understand app composition.
- `src/Data.jsx` demonstrates how items are loaded and rendered — good place to add sorting/filtering.
- `src/DatagridToolbar.jsx` contains the UI for user actions; wire its callbacks to the parent `Data.jsx`.
- `src/DataItem.jsx` is the single-item presentation — keep it pure and focused.
